## I have scar tissue

```markdown
Is your app alone and trembling in a dark,
single-region with failures,
latency, and retry storms closing in on every side?
```

Notes:
- That was my app, I was there
- It was my team, supporting millions of users at the time
- No control over what happened in the datacenter
- And my phone ringing if something went wrong

## Hundreds of Global2000 & Fortune500 customers

Notes:
- Today, I have worked with hundreds of customers
- I'm not alone
- You are not alone
- I've worked through these problems
- In different forms but these are most common

## Outages

- Money Lost
- Trust Lost <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Momentum Lost <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Sleep Lost <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

---

- Outages don't happen every day
- Active-Passive datacenters waste money every day <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Notes:
- My scar tissue has turned into something else

---

- Active-Active can improve capacity & resiliency 
- Without additional infrastructure expense <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- If you are upgrading from active-passive <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

```markdown
Raise your hand
if you like spending money
on infrastructure that isn't being used
```
