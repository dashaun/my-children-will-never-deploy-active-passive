## Step 1 - The warmer
Something to connect with the audience.  Know the audience.
 - I have seen and heard some of these challenges from other customers very similar to yours
 - These 3 challenges come up as the most troubling
 - Is that what you are seeing?  Or would you add something to that list?

## Step 2 - The reframe
 - Well prepared insights
 - Catch customer off guard with unexpected viewpoint
 - Looking for 'I never thought of it that way' response
 - This needs to teach the customer something new - not something they have already considered solutions for - define the next RFP
 - Do not be timid - surprise the customer

## Step 3 - Rational Drowning
 - show why is it worth customers time
 - Numbers driven rational about why they should think different
 - Looking for "I didn't realize we were spending so much X on this"
 - Convince customer this is problem worth solving
 - Show them why it matters

## Step 4 - Emotional Impact
 - Make it personal
 - Story telling with solid narrative - share similar path - seen this play out
 - Looking for customer to replay similar scenario in their head
 - Should relate to pain they are facing every day

## Step 5 - A New Way
 - Convince them of the solution
 - Solution still - not supplier
 - Show how much better things would be if they were doing something different - (still not product)

## Step 6 - Our solution
 - Demonstrate how our solution is better suited than any other
 - Here is how we can deliver it better than anyone else
 - Unique capabilities - we defined the RFP - here is how we fit
 - The commercial AND the teaching

Time of day matters

Start of the day for the audience, will have the most open mind. (Except on Monday!)
After a break/meal, audience will have an open mind.
If the meeting is right before lunch, or at the end of the day, audience mind is elsewhere and/or closed.
